Good day,

  If you happen across this I have simply created this for possible future help with Database creation.
  I am currently creating a database that a user can create, submit, route, approve, comment and track purchase requests.
  
  If you have any insight that would be amazing as I am pretty new to MS Access and SQL. 
  
Current plans are to create most the database on MS Access and then migrate the back end to SQL. And figure out what to do with the rest. 

Also its maybe worth mentioning I am an IT Student at ASU, I dont not currently work in any coding or IT career field. 

If you stumble on this and can give advice thanks in advance!

Andrew
